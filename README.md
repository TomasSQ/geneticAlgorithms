# Simple problem solver with genetic algorithms
All this source has been developed to be part of my University project (UNICAMP) of Inteligent Artificial class (MC906 - Esther).

You shall use and/or improve this in the way you want.

Currently the GenectAlgorithmSolver has been tested and worked for TSP, Knapsack (also with some modifications), N-Queens problem, Path-finder of a Maze (not so good results here).

I will or will not update this repo with more examples.
