# Simple probleman solver with genetic algorithms
All this source has been developed to be part of an University project of Inteligent Artificial lecture.

You shall use and/or improve this in the way you want.

Currently the GenectAlgorithmSolver has been tested and worked for TSP, Knapsack (also with some modifications), N-Queens probleman, Path-finder of a Maze (not so good results here).

I may or may not update this repo with more examples.
